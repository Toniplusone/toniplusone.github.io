<ul>
	<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>I'm 30 years old. I was born in Kansas but have lived in the Charlotte area since I was 1. So this is home. I have a 7 year old son named Julian. My life goals are to live on my own small farm, travel, and raise good humans.</li>
	<li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have always been in the customer service industry. I have managed at three restaurants and I am currently a full-time manager. I am also in search of trades that I can add to my list so that I can live a more free lifestyle.</li>
	<li><strong>Academic Background</strong>: I went to Aveda beauty school twice, and dropped out both times. The beauty industry is not for me. I also went to Kaplan for Social Work but decided against that career path. I am currently in school to get an IT degree in full stack development.</li>
	<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I use an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 10</li>
	<li><strong>Courses I'm taking &amp; Why:</strong>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>WEB 115</strong></em>-This class is required for my degree but it is also useful in learning web design and development.</li>
	<li><em><strong>WEB 140</strong></em>-This course introduces web development tools.</li>
	<li><em><strong>CSC 121</strong></em>-This course teaches Python..</li>
</ul>
	</li>


<li><strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</strong> I was named Class Clown in 2010 for my Senior Year. </li>
<li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I just bought a house so my son can grow up in a stable home. </li>
