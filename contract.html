<h1>Toni Dotson's WEB 115 Course Contract</h1>


<p>
I, <a href = "introduction.html">Toni Dotson </a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2022 Web 115 Web Markup & Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>

<p>
I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world.<br>
I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br>
I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
<br>As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absence
</p>


<p>Signed: Toni Linae Dotson, August 20, 2022.</P>
