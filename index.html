	<h2>
	Course Contract
	</h2>

<p>
	I, <a href="introduction.html">Toni L. Dotson</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2021 WEB115-N801 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
</p>

<p>
	I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
</p>

<p>
	I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
</p>
